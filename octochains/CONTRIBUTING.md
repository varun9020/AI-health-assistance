# Contributing to Octochains

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Octochains! It’s people like you who will help build the universal reasoning layer for high-stakes AI.

---

### Contribution Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.

2. Code your contribution following the directory standards below.

3. Test your agent or demo in an isolated environment.

4. Submit a Pull Request (PR). Note that all PRs are personally vetted for logic, safety, and architectural fit.

---

### The "Zero-Dependency" Golden Rule

**Octochains must remain lightweight.**

**Do NOT** submit Pull Requests that add heavy ML SDKs (`langchain`, `llama-index`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `transformers`, etc.) to the `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.

The core framework (`src/octochains`) must only rely on standard Python libraries.

If you are building an integration, demo, or specific wrapper, place it in the `demo-examples/` directory where users can choose to install those dependencies themselves.

---

### The Hub Architecture

Octochains uses a Package Registry system. To ensure users can use clean shorthand imports, every new component must be registered.

---

### 1. Adding a New Agent

Agents live in domain-specific folders inside `src/octochains/agents/`.

### Placement

Create a new `.py` file in an existing domain folder (e.g., `medical/`) or create a new domain folder if it doesn't exist.

### Requirements

- Inherit from the `octochains.Agent` base class.
- Define a clear `role`, `goal`, and `input_description` in `super().__init__`.
- **Dependency Injection:** Do not hardcode LLM calls inside your agent. Your agent must accept `llm_callable` in its `__init__` and pass it to the base class.
- Implement the `execute(self, problem_data: str) -> Any` method.
- Use `self._build_prompt(problem_data)` to automatically inject the double-blind isolation instructions and `@tool` schemas.

### Registration (Crucial)

You must update the `__init__.py` inside your domain folder to export your agent.

```python
# src/octochains/agents/medical/__init__.py

from .your_new_file import YourAgentClass
```

---

### 2. Adding a New Aggregator

Aggregators live in `src/octochains/aggregators/`.

## Placement

Create your logic file in the `aggregators` directory.

## Requirements

- Inherit from `octochains.Aggregator`.
- Aggregators process a dictionary of reports (`Dict[str, str]`).
- **Structured Outputs:** Aggregators return `Any`. You are highly encouraged to build aggregators that return clean JSON dictionaries or Pydantic models for API readiness.

### 💡 Example: Creating a Cybersecurity Agent

Here is how a typical "Expert" agent should look. This example uses a `@tool` and follows the updated Octochains BYO-LLM standard:

```python
from octochains import Agent, tool
from typing import Callable, Any


class NetworkSecurityAgent(Agent):
    """
    This agent specializes in scanning network logs for unauthorized
    access attempts and firewall misconfigurations.
    """

    def __init__(self, llm_callable: Callable[[str], Any]):

        # 1. Define the Identity:
        # This is passed to the base class prompt builder

        super().__init__(
            role="Network Security Specialist",
            goal="Identify active intrusion patterns and open-port vulnerabilities.",
            input_description="A raw network log or firewall configuration file.",
            llm_callable=llm_callable
        )

    @tool
    def check_port_status(self, port: int) -> str:
        """
        Queries the system firewall for the status of a specific port.

        Args:
            port: The network port number to check (e.g., 22, 80).
        """

        # Logic for the tool goes here

        protected_ports = [22, 3389]

        if port in protected_ports:
            return f"Port {port} is OPEN and vulnerable."

        return f"Port {port} is closed/secured."

    def execute(self, problem_data: str) -> Any:
        """
        The 'problem_data' parameter is the full complex problem
        broadcasted by the Engine.
        """

        # 2. The base class automatically builds the prompt
        # and injects the check_port_status tool schema!

        prompt = self._build_prompt(problem_data)

        # 3. Execute using the user's provided LLM

        return self.llm_callable(prompt)
```

### Creating Demo Examples

Demos are the best way to show Octochains in action.

To keep the core framework lightweight, we enforce **Strict Demo Isolation**.

## Placement

Create a numbered folder in `demo-examples/`.

Example:

```plaintext
demo-examples/02-cybersecurity-threat-hunt
```

## Structure

```plaintext
demo-examples/XX-your-demo/
├── requirements.txt  <-- MANDATORY: List all demo-specific libraries
├── run_demo.py       <-- MANDATORY: The entry point for the demo
└── README.md         <-- Optional: Explain the use case
```

### The Dependency Rule

If your demo requires libraries not found in the core `octochains` package (like `pandas`, `litellm`, or `biopython`), they must be listed in your demo's `requirements.txt`.

❌ Do not add them to the core `pyproject.toml`.

# Code Standards

To keep the Octochains codebase clean and maintainable for everyone, please adhere to the following standards.

---

### Threading Safety

⚠️ **Critical:** Agents in Octochains run in parallel threads.

Avoid using:
- Global state
- Mutable module-level variables
- Non-thread-safe resources within an Agent's `execute` method

Your code should be **Stateless** relative to other agents.

---

### Type Hinting

We follow modern Python practices.

All public methods and function signatures must include Python type hints.

Use our custom `LLMCallable` alias (`Callable[[str], Any]`) for model execution parameters.

---

## Documentation

We prioritize clarity.

Include descriptive docstrings for:
- All classes
- All `@tool` methods

Remember:
The text in your tool's docstring is what the LLM uses to understand how to call it.

---

### Error Handling

Never let a failed LLM call crash the Engine.

Rely on the `format_output` safety nets in the base classes to prevent dictionary mapping crashes.
