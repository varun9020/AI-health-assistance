The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.

[0.2.0] - 2026-05-18
Added
Dependency Injection (BYO-LLM): Added llm_callable initialization parameters to both Agent and Aggregator base classes. This completely decouples the framework from any specific LLM provider or SDK.

Custom Type Alias: Introduced LLMCallable = Callable[[str], Any] to standardize model execution signatures across the framework.

Sensible Defaults & Dynamic Tools: Added the _build_prompt() helper method to the Agent base class.

Automatically enforces "Double-Blind" isolation instructions.
Dynamically discovers and injects @tool JSON schemas directly into the system prompt.
Engine Safety Net: Added format_output to the Agent base class to safely stringify unexpected agent return types before Phase 1 engine mapping, preventing dictionary mapping crashes.

Changed
Structured Outputs Supported: Changed the return type of Aggregator.execute() and Report.consensus from str to Any.
Aggregators can now natively return parsed JSON dictionaries or Pydantic models directly to the user's application.
[0.1.1] - 2026-05-10
Added
Agent Metadata: Added a required input_description parameter to the Agent base class. This ensures all agents published to the Hub clearly define their expected data format (e.g., "JSON string of patient vitals" vs. "Raw text SEC filing").
Changed
License Update: Transitioned from MIT to Business Source License (BSL) 1.1 to protect enterprise interests.
Aggregator Refactor: Renamed Aggregator.synthesize() to Aggregator.execute(). This reflects that aggregators can perform any logical operation, not just synthesis.
Scientific Alignment: Rewrote README.md to include performance benchmarks (+80.8% accuracy) based on the 2026 Google/MIT Scaling Paper.
Removed
Unbiased Synthesis: Removed the problem_data argument from the Aggregator.execute() method.
Rationale: To ensure zero-bias synthesis, the Aggregator is now "blind" to the initial input, forcing it to judge the final verdict solely based on the conflicting or supporting evidence provided by the specialized agents.
[0.1.0] - 2026-04-18
Added
Initial release of the Octochains Parallel Engine.
Multi-expert broadcast logic for decomposable reasoning tasks.
Abstract Base Classes for Agent and Aggregator.
Updated documentation with scientific validation from the 2026 Google/MIT Scaling Paper.
